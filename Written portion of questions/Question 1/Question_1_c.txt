The parameter contributing the most to the the error in T 
is D, the orbital distance from Earth.
This is due to the fact that the relative error in D is much
greater than the relative errors of the other 
parameters by an order of 10. This is reflected 
when calculating its relative error contribution to 
T with it contributing approximately 98% of the error.
